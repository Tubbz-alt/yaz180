# YAZ180

There needed to be Yet Another Z180 computer created.
And so, here it is.

The YAZ180 is a modern single board computer, based on the tradition rich Z180 CPU and the AMD Am9511A-1 APU.

It is not a perfect mix of modern and "ancient" computing technology, but it is my attempt to do just that. To marry CPU/APU technology from 40 years ago, with modern I2C, USB, and WiFi capabilities.

The YAZ180 is supported by the Z88DK and it is designed to work with both CP/M and modern C compiled programs.
